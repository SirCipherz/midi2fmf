#+TITLE: midi2fmf

* Getting Started
Just run this :
#+BEGIN_SRC
  $ ./midi2fmf.py music.mid
#+END_SRC

It will write the fmf file on stdout, if you want to write to a file you can do this :

#+BEGIN_SRC
  $ ./midi2fmf.py music.mid > music.fmf
#+END_SRC

* Thanks
This is based on [[https://gist.github.com/nemanjan00/591bc3aedbb09a6f8fb623e862232870][this]] project with a few modifications of my own, including shell arguments support instead of modifying the script and a minimum note lengh (the original script was for some reason creating very short pauses while the flipper only supports 1/128 of a note as its very minimum).

* License
As the original script didn't featured any license and I didn't just reuploaded the file without any change, I took the liberty to license it under the GPLv3 license.
